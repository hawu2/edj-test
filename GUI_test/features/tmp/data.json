Nothing about string names is defined by the datetime module, \n        and there\u2019s no requirement that it mean anything in particular. For example, \n        \u201cGMT\u201d, \u201cUTC\u201d, \u201c-500\u201d, \u201c-5:00\u201d, \u201cEDT\u201d, \u201cUS/Eastern\u201d, \u201cAmerica/New York\u201d are all valid replies. \n        Return None if a string name isn\u2019t known. Note that this is a method rather than a fixed \n        string primarily because some tzinfo subclasses will wish to return different names depending \n        on the specific value of dt passed, especially if the tzinfo class is accounting for daylight time"}
